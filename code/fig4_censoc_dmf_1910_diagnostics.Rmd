title: "Figure 4 - CenSoc DMF 1910 Diagnostics"

Summary: This .Rmd file contains code to replicate Figure 4 in "Mortality Modeling of Partially Observed Cohorts Using Administrative Death Records." 

Description of Figure 4: For CenSoc-DMF cohort of 1910: panel (a) shows a histogram of age of death for those who did and did not complete high school; the black curves shows our Gompertz-model based estimates of the number of deaths.  Panel (b) plots the model-based hazard ratio estimates (solid lines) vs. the inferred observed hazard ratios (dashed lines) for those who completed high school (blue) and those who did not (red).
